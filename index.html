    <p class="one" id="first">Hello! My name is Sara and I am currently a
      highschool student. I like a lot of things and
      think that I am pretty good at working with
      others. I learn pretty quickly and have a big
      family so I am also good with kids! I have a variety
      of skills, such as being good at cooking,
      cleaning, video games, taking care of children,
      and being able to use technology pretty well!</p>
